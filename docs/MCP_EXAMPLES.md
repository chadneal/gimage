## Image Generation Workflows

### Example 4: Generate Multiple Style Variations

**User Prompt:**
```
Generate 3 different versions of a fantasy forest scene:
1. Photorealistic style with detailed trees and lighting
2. Artistic watercolor painting style
3. Anime style with vibrant colors

Use 1024x1024 size for all.
```

**Claude's Actions:**
```
I'll generate three different style variations of a fantasy forest scene for you.

[Calls generate_image three times with different style parameters]
```

**Results:**
- `forest_photorealistic.png` - Highly detailed, natural lighting
- `forest_watercolor.png` - Soft edges, artistic interpretation
- `forest_anime.png` - Bold colors, stylized rendering

**Follow-up Prompt:**
```
I like the anime version best. Can you generate 3 more variations with different seasons - spring, summer, winter?
```

### Example 5: Reproducible Generation with Seeds

**User Prompt:**
```
Generate an image of a dragon with seed 12345. Then generate the exact same image again to verify reproducibility.
```

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Using seeds for consistent results
- Useful for A/B testing or generating variations
- Same seed + same prompt = identical image

**Claude's Response:**
```
I'll generate the dragon image twice with the same seed to demonstrate reproducibility.

[Calls generate_image with seed=12345 twice]

Both images are identical. Seeds ensure reproducible results, which is useful when you want to:
- Regenerate an image you liked
- Share generation parameters with others
- Create consistent variations
```

### Example 6: Using Negative Prompts

**User Prompt:**
```
Generate a beautiful garden scene, but I don't want any people, buildings, or modern objects in it. Just nature.
```

**Claude's Actions:**
```
I'll generate a garden scene and use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements.

[Calls generate_image with negative="people, buildings, modern objects, cars, technology"]
```

**Result:**
Pure nature scene without any human elements or modern objects.

### Example 7: High-Resolution Generation with Imagen 4

**User Prompt:**
```
I need a professional 2K image for print. Generate a hyper-realistic mountain landscape using the highest quality model available.
```

**Claude's Actions:**
```
For professional print quality, I'll use Imagen 4 with 2048x2048 resolution.

[Calls generate_image with model="imagen-4", size="2048x2048"]

Note: This requires Vertex AI authentication. The result will be higher quality and larger file size than the free Gemini models.
```

## Image Processing Pipelines

### Example 8: Prepare Photo for Instagram

**User Prompt:**
```
I have portrait.jpg (3000x4000). Prepare it for Instagram:
- Crop to square 1080x1080 from the center
- Compress to 90% quality
- Save as instagram-ready.jpg
```

**Claude's Multi-Step Process:**
```
I'll prepare your photo for Instagram in three steps.

Step 1: Calculate center crop coordinates
[Image is 3000x4000, so crop from (960, 1460) with 1080x1080 size]

Step 2: Crop to square
[Calls crop_image with x=960, y=1460, width=1080, height=1080]

Step 3: Compress
[Calls compress_image with quality=90]

✓ Instagram-ready image saved to: instagram-ready.jpg
Size: 1080x1080
Quality: 90%
File size: 245 KB
```

### Example 9: Optimize Images for Web Performance

**User Prompt:**
```
I have 30 product images in 'products-raw' folder (all PNG, 5000x5000 each). Optimize them for web:
1. Resize to maximum 1200x1200
2. Convert to WebP format
3. Save in 'products-optimized' folder
```

**Claude's Workflow:**
```
I'll optimize your product images for web in two batch operations.

Step 1: Batch resize all images to 1200x1200
[Calls batch_resize with width=1200, height=1200]
✓ Resized 30 images to 1200x1200

Step 2: Batch convert to WebP format
[Calls batch_convert with format="webp"]
✓ Converted 30 images to WebP

Results:
- Original: 30 PNG files, 450 MB total
- Optimized: 30 WebP files, 38 MB total
- Savings: 412 MB (91.6% reduction)
- Load time improvement: ~12x faster
```

### Example 10: Create Responsive Image Set

**User Prompt:**
```
Take hero-image.jpg and create a responsive image set for my website:
- Large: 1920x1080 (desktop)
- Medium: 1024x576 (tablet)
- Small: 640x360 (mobile)
- Thumbnail: 320x180 (preview)

Compress all to 85% quality and convert to WebP.
```

**Claude's Detailed Process:**
```
I'll create a complete responsive image set with 4 sizes.

[Calls resize_image 4 times with different dimensions]
[Calls compress_image 4 times with quality=85]
[Calls convert_image 4 times to WebP format]

✓ Responsive image set created:
- hero-large.webp (1920x1080, 156 KB)
- hero-medium.webp (1024x576, 45 KB)
- hero-small.webp (640x360, 18 KB)
- hero-thumb.webp (320x180, 6 KB)

You can now use these in responsive HTML with srcset:
<img srcset="hero-small.webp 640w, hero-medium.webp 1024w, hero-large.webp 1920w"
     src="hero-medium.webp" alt="Hero image">
```

1. Convert all to JPG format
2. Resize to 2560x1440 (QHD resolution)
3. Compress to 95% quality (maintain quality)
4. Use 8 parallel workers for speed

Save results in 'portfolio-web'.
```

**Claude's Execution:**
```
I'll process your portfolio in an optimized batch workflow.

[Calls batch_convert with format="jpg", workers=8]
✓ Converted 200 TIFF → JPG

[Calls batch_resize with width=2560, height=1440, workers=8]
✓ Resized 200 images to 2560x1440

[Calls batch_compress with quality=95, workers=8]

Final Results:
- Processed: 200 images
- Time: ~3 minutes (8 workers)
- Original size: 4.2 GB (TIFF)
- Final size: 280 MB (JPG)
- Savings: 3.92 GB (93.3%)
- Average file: 1.4 MB per image
```

### Example 12: Prepare Images for CDN Deployment

**User Prompt:**

- All to WebP format
- Maximum 1600x1200 resolution
- 85% quality
- Output to 'cdn-ready'
```

**Claude's Strategy:**
```
I'll standardize your blog images for optimal CDN delivery.

Analysis: Found 500 images (250 PNG, 200 JPG, 50 BMP)

Step 1: Batch resize to maximum 1600x1200
[Calls batch_resize]
✓ Resized 500 images

Step 2: Batch compress to 85% quality
[Calls batch_compress with quality=85]
✓ Compressed 500 images

Step 3: Batch convert to WebP
[Calls batch_convert with format="webp"]
✓ Converted 500 images to WebP

Summary:
- Original: 1.8 GB (mixed formats)
- CDN-ready: 185 MB (WebP)
- Savings: 1.615 GB (89.7%)
- CDN bandwidth reduction: ~10x
- Estimated cost savings: $50-100/month
```

### Example 13: Archive Compression Without Quality Loss

**User Prompt:**
```
I have 1000 scanned documents (PNG format, 300 DPI) in 'scans' folder. Compress them for archival storage while maintaining visual quality.
```

**Claude's Approach:**
```
For archival documents, I'll use high-quality compression (95%) to maintain readability.

[Calls batch_compress with quality=95, workers=8]

✓ Batch compression complete
Processed: 1000 images
Original: 8.5 GB
Compressed: 2.1 GB
Savings: 6.4 GB (75.3%)

All documents maintain 300 DPI and readability. The compression removes redundant data without affecting text clarity.

## Tips for Effective Prompts

### Be Specific
```
❌ "Generate an image of a forest"

```

### Specify Technical Requirements
```
❌ "Make it smaller"
✓ "Resize to 800x600 pixels for web use"
```

### Use Negative Prompts
```
✓ "Generate a street scene, but exclude people, cars, and modern buildings"
```

### Chain Operations Clearly
```
✓ "First resize to 1024x1024, then compress to 85% quality, then convert to WebP"
```

### Provide Context
```
✓ "I need hero images for a SaaS landing page targeting B2B customers"
```
