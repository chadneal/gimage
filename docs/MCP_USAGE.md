## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Connecting

**Symptoms**: Claude shows no gimage tools available

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify gimage is installed**
   ```bash
   which gimage
   ```
   Should show the path to gimage binary.

2. **Test manual startup**
   ```bash
   gimage serve
   ```
   Should start without errors. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

3. **Check Claude Desktop configuration**
   - Verify JSON syntax is correct
   - Ensure file path matches your system
   - Check for typos in command/args

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   - Quit completely (not just close window)
   - Reopen application

5. **Check Claude logs**
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
   - Look for error messages related to gimage

### Image Generation Fails

**Symptoms**: Error messages when trying to generate images

**Solutions**:

1. **Check authentication status**
   ```bash
   gimage auth status
   ```
   This shows which credentials are configured and their sources.

2. **Verify API key is configured**
   ```bash
   # Use interactive setup
   gimage auth setup

   # OR set environment variable (recommended)
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Test credentials**
   ```bash
   gimage auth test
   ```
   This makes real API calls to verify your credentials work.

4. **Test generation manually**
   ```bash
   gimage generate "test image"
   ```
   If this works, MCP server should work too.

5. **Check API key validity**
   - Ensure key hasn't expired
   - Verify it's correctly copied (no extra spaces)
   - Get a new key if needed: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

6. **Verify internet connection**
   - Gemini API requires internet access
   - Check firewall settings

### Permission Errors

**Symptoms**: "Permission denied" when processing images

**Solutions**:

1. **Check file permissions**
   ```bash
   ls -la /path/to/image.jpg
   ```

2. **Ensure write access to output directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p output-folder
   chmod 755 output-folder
   ```

3. **Use absolute paths**
   Instead of: `photo.jpg`
   Use: `/Users/yourname/photos/photo.jpg`

### Batch Operations Slow

**Symptoms**: Batch processing takes too long

**Solutions**:

1. **Increase workers**
   "Process all images in photos/ using 8 workers for faster processing"

2. **Process in smaller batches**
   Split large directories into smaller chunks

3. **Check disk space**
   Ensure sufficient space for output files

```

### Reproducible Generation

Use seeds for consistent results:

```
"Generate an image with seed 12345 of a mountain landscape"
"Generate the same image again with seed 12345 to verify it's identical"
```

### Complex Multi-Step Workflows

Claude can chain multiple operations:

```
"Please help me with this workflow:
1. Generate an AI image of a fantasy castle (1024x1024)
2. Create 3 different sizes: 2048x2048, 1024x1024, 512x512
3. Compress all of them to 90% quality
4. Convert to WebP format
5. Save in a folder called 'castle-variants'"
```

4. **Try different models** - Each has strengths
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash: Fast, great for most uses
   - Imagen 4: Highest quality, best for professional work

### Image Processing

1. **Know your target** - Understand final use case
   - Web: 1920x1080 or smaller, WebP format, 85% quality
   - Print: Larger sizes, PNG/TIFF, 95-100% quality
   - Mobile: 750x1334, 80% quality

2. **Batch similar operations** - More efficient
   - Process all images in a folder at once
   - Use consistent settings across related images

3. **Preserve originals** - Always work on copies
   - Use explicit output paths
   - Create separate directories for processed images

4. **Check results** - Verify quality meets needs
